For a relaxed and successful start to your studies, the DHBW Heidenheim offers various courses to prepare students for their studies. For aspiring students, the DHBW Heidenheim offers preparatory courses in math and physics. 
You can already begin with the courses around half a year before the start of your studies with the mathematics preparation course "StudiStartUp" and thus bridge larger
gaps in knowledge over a long period of time through self-study. To supplement this, the foundational course or preliminary courses can be attended if required.
